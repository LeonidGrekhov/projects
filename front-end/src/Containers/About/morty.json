  "description": "Morty is 14 years old and is a student at Harry Herpson High School along with his older sister Summer. Morty seems to be suffering from anxiety and is easily stressed, largely as a result of traumatic experiences during his adventures with Rick. He is often dismissed as idiotic by Rick and others, but is shown to be wiser than his grandfather in terms of understanding people's feelings, and is capable of explosive anger and moral outrage in objection to Rick's attitude and actions."
